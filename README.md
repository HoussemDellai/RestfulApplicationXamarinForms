# RestfulApplicationXamarinForms
Android, iOS and Windows Phone clients built using Xamarin.Forms platform, that connects to HTTP web services.

Xamarin.Forms is a great technology for building native cross platform applications. 
It uses C# and Visual Studio, that .NET developers already know to deliver apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone based on one shared code base for both business logic and views. In addition to that, it uses almost the 'same' technology as XAML, that means making MVVM apps even easier.

This sample will show you how to leverage the strengthness of this technology to build mobile apps that connects to HTTP web services (http://intilaqemployees.azurewebsites.net/api/employeesapi) to perform CRUD operations.

This application requires Visual Studio 2013.
You can download it from http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.
And Xamarin platform: http://xamarin.com/platform.
